The most important nature that <change><selection></selection><tag><symbol>AR</symbol><correct>a </correct></tag></change>student council president has to have is being reliable. That means that keeping promises is important. So, I promise three important things and promise to keep them whatever happens in the future. Firstly, I will change the school cafeteria. As you know, we don't have many <change><selection></selection><tag><symbol>MW</symbol><correct>menus </correct></tag></change>to choose there, for the cooks' ease they have only 2 kinds of <change><selection>menu</selection><tag><symbol>PL</symbol><correct>menus</correct></tag></change>. I will make a buffet style <change><selection>of </selection><tag><symbol>D</symbol><correct></correct></tag></change>school restaurant. But there is a rule. We can have only one plate of meal, and if we have leftovers <change><selection></selection><tag><symbol>AR</symbol><correct>a </correct></tag></change><change><selection>certain amount of</selection><tag><symbol>D</symbol><correct></correct></tag></change> fine will be imposed. Secondly, I will change the graduation trip. We have to follow what <change><selection></selection><tag><symbol>AR</symbol><correct>the </correct></tag></change>teachers <change><selection>decided</selection><tag><symbol>VT</symbol><correct>decide</correct></tag></change>, but I will gather <change><selection></selection><tag><symbol>AR</symbol><correct>the </correct></tag></change>students' opinion and divide <change><selection></selection><tag><symbol>MW</symbol><correct>them </correct></tag></change>into 5 groups, so that each group can go anywhere they want. Of course <change><selection></selection><tag><symbol>MW</symbol><correct>together </correct></tag></change>with teachers. Lastly, I will make <change><selection>an</selection><tag><symbol>AR</symbol><correct>a</correct></tag></change> rain desk. We sometimes have an unexpected rain, and sometimes forget to bring umbrellas. We can borrow umbrellas or raincoats here without any charge. But, If we don't bring <change><selection></selection><tag><symbol>MW</symbol><correct>them </correct></tag></change>back in a week, we will be fined. Okay, how is my promises? Can you expect wonderful school life? Then, vote for me, please, thank you.",

So, I will convince school president and buy more new chairs and desk. In addition, we always concerned about the quality of school cafeteria. I will also ask him to give better taste and better place. As last, we hardly go to field trip to abroad. I will set a fund to go to the trip all together.

I think their demographic size is getting bigger in the future, so we have to plan to penetrate this market. I suggest that we offer a small gift which young women like.

Korea and Chile signed FTA in 2002, but it took two years to be effective because local farmers in Korea strongly opposed. To be effective, the agreement should be ratified by the National Assembly. As you can see, the lawmakers of Korea were concerned on local farmers. That was the first FTA agreement, and the National Assembly ratified it in 2004. I was curious <change><selection></selection><tag><symbol>MW</symbol><correct>about </correct></tag></change>how the first FTA affected the trades between countries after it was effective. First of all, the trade between two countries increased dramatically, 28.3% although average increase with other countries is 14.8%. Secondly, we could increase a market share in Chile from 3. 0% to 7. 2%. Finally, the experience of the first FTA agreement led to more FTA agreements with other countries, e.g. EU, USA,China, etc. However, there might be some critics saying that only the owners of large companies in Korea could get huge benefits, and local farmers were seriously damaged. But, in my opinion, it is way that we should go.",

To begin with, I'd like to tell you about the first time I met Walter. I ran a small business, and he was introduced by the consultant who had worked at my office. He learned Korean, and wanted to practice Korean he learned. One of thing I remember is that Walter liked Kimchi, Korean salad very much, and it means that he is very adoptable, and flexible. If we look at Walter and Soonja, we see a shining example of devotion. They always support one another in their decisions. Moreover, they love each other very much. Walter, and Sooja, I do appreciate the party for all of us. It is very kind of you. And, I really hope that the warmth you feel for each other will bring both of you everlasting happiness.

It may look old-fashioned, but I had no trouble working up there for the last three years. The old one is actually beautiful as it is sitting right next to the historic royal palace of a breathtakingly fascinating structure. I miss those days I had a cup of coffee looking down on the beautiful palace in my snug office.",
